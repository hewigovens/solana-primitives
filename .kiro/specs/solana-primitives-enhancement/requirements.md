# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Solana Primitives library is a Rust crate that provides fundamental data structures and tools needed to construct and submit Solana transactions. Currently at version 0.1.2, it offers core functionality for transaction building, instruction creation, and RPC communication with Solana nodes. This enhancement spec aims to expand the library's capabilities, improve developer experience, and add missing features that would make it a comprehensive solution for Solana development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Instruction Support

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want comprehensive instruction support for all major Solana programs, so that I can build complex applications without implementing low-level instruction serialization myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to create SPL Token 2022 instructions THEN the library SHALL provide helper functions for all Token 2022 instruction types
2. WHEN I need to create Stake Program instructions THEN the library SHALL provide helper functions for staking, delegation, and withdrawal operations
3. WHEN I need to create Vote Program instructions THEN the library SHALL provide helper functions for validator voting operations
4. WHEN I need to create Address Lookup Table instructions THEN the library SHALL provide helper functions for creating, extending, and closing lookup tables
5. WHEN I need to create custom program instructions THEN the library SHALL provide a flexible instruction builder that supports arbitrary program IDs and data

### Requirement 2: Advanced Transaction Features

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want to use advanced transaction features like versioned transactions and address lookup tables, so that I can optimize transaction costs and handle complex multi-instruction scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a versioned transaction THEN the library SHALL support both Legacy and V0 transaction formats
2. WHEN I use address lookup tables THEN the library SHALL automatically resolve account addresses and optimize transaction size
3. WHEN I build transactions with many accounts THEN the library SHALL use address lookup tables to reduce transaction size when beneficial
4. WHEN I need to simulate transactions THEN the library SHALL provide simulation capabilities before actual submission
5. WHEN I work with transaction priorities THEN the library SHALL support compute budget instructions for priority fees

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Cryptographic Operations

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want complete cryptographic functionality for key management and transaction signing, so that I can handle all aspects of Solana transaction lifecycle securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to generate keypairs THEN the library SHALL provide secure keypair generation functions
2. WHEN I need to sign transactions THEN the library SHALL support both single and multi-signature scenarios
3. WHEN I work with Program Derived Addresses THEN the library SHALL provide comprehensive PDA utilities including bump seed finding
4. WHEN I need to verify signatures THEN the library SHALL provide signature verification functions
5. WHEN I handle seed-based account creation THEN the library SHALL provide utilities for deterministic address generation

### Requirement 4: Enhanced RPC Client Capabilities

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want a comprehensive RPC client that supports all Solana RPC methods, so that I can interact with the blockchain without needing additional HTTP clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query account information THEN the library SHALL support all account-related RPC methods with proper deserialization
2. WHEN I need transaction history THEN the library SHALL provide methods to fetch and parse transaction signatures and details
3. WHEN I work with program accounts THEN the library SHALL support getProgramAccounts with filtering capabilities
4. WHEN I need real-time updates THEN the library SHALL support WebSocket subscriptions for account and program changes
5. WHEN I handle RPC errors THEN the library SHALL provide comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms

### Requirement 5: Developer Experience Improvements

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want excellent developer experience with comprehensive documentation, examples, and debugging tools, so that I can be productive quickly and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I learn the library THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive documentation with code examples for all major use cases
2. WHEN I debug transactions THEN the library SHALL provide transaction inspection and debugging utilities
3. WHEN I need examples THEN the library SHALL include practical examples for common Solana development patterns
4. WHEN I encounter errors THEN the library SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages with context
5. WHEN I integrate with other tools THEN the library SHALL provide serialization compatibility with other Solana libraries

### Requirement 6: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want a performant and reliable library that handles edge cases gracefully, so that my applications can operate efficiently in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I process many transactions THEN the library SHALL provide efficient batch processing capabilities
2. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the library SHALL implement intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN I work with large datasets THEN the library SHALL provide streaming and pagination support for RPC calls
4. WHEN I deploy to production THEN the library SHALL include comprehensive logging and metrics collection
5. WHEN I handle concurrent operations THEN the library SHALL be thread-safe and support async/await patterns throughout

### Requirement 7: Testing and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a Solana developer, I want comprehensive testing utilities and validation tools, so that I can ensure my transactions and programs work correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I test my code THEN the library SHALL provide mock RPC clients for unit testing
2. WHEN I validate transactions THEN the library SHALL provide transaction validation utilities
3. WHEN I test with different networks THEN the library SHALL support easy switching between mainnet, testnet, and devnet
4. WHEN I need test data THEN the library SHALL provide utilities for generating test keypairs and accounts
5. WHEN I benchmark performance THEN the library SHALL include performance testing utilities and benchmarks
